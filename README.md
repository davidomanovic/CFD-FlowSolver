# CFD-FlowSolver
This project implements a basic 2D Finite Element Method (FEM)-based solver for solving steady-state incompressible flows governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The project is intended as an educational tool and a showcase of numerical and C++ programming skills. It can also be extended for unsteady problems or coupled multi-physics scenarios.
